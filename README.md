# Using Linear Regression to Predict Video Game Sales

# Project Overview

In this project, I wanted to see if the total sales of a video game can be predicted by knowing general information about the game,
such as the genre of the game, the publisher, the console(s) the game is released on, and finally the weekly sales. Data was 
collected from VGCharts.com because it contained everything I was looking to obtain. 

If you want to see how I scraped the data from this website, please view my notebook titled: 'Video Game Scraper Notebook'.

Once I obtained the data, I saved it onto a Pandas DataFrame and proceeded to further clean up my data.
